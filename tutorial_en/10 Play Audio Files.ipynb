    "Due to security reasons, you cannot directly access the audio device through JupyterLab (environment limitations). The code blocks provided here are not meant for user execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code presented here is extracted from the product's main program, audio_ctrl.py. You can refer to this code to understand how the main program implements the functionality of playing audio files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Audio-related Functionality in the Product Main Program\n",
    "Inside the folder of the product's main program, there is a folder named \"sounds\", which contains many subfolders: connected, others, recv_new_cmd, robot_started, searching_for_target, target_detected, target_locked.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the default program provided, only one audio file is placed in each of the connected and robot_started subfolders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the robot's main program starts running, it will automatically play a random audio file from the robot_started folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a client connects to this web application using a browser, a random audio file from the connected folder will be played automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can place custom audio files in these folders as voice packs to customize your product further."
