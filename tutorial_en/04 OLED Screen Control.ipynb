    "# OLED Screen Control\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to control an OLED display connected to an ESP32 module using JSON commands. OLED displays are widely used for showing various types of information, such as text and images.\n",

    "OLED displays communicate with the ESP32 module via the I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) interface. These displays are capable of showing custom text content and support multi-line display.\n",
    "\n",
    "The product comes with an OLED display that communicates with the ESP32 module through the I2C interface. Upon powering up, the display automatically shows some basic information about the device. The content displayed on the screen can be altered by sending JSON commands from the host device.\n",

    "    - Controls the display to show custom content.\n",
    "    - `lineNum` refers to the line number, and a single JSON command can change the content of one line. For the commonly used 0.91-inch OLED displays, the value of lineNum can be 0, 1, 2, or 3, allowing for four lines in total.\n",
    "     - `Text` is the content you wish to display on that line. If the content exceeds the line length, it will automatically wrap to the next line, potentially overwriting the last line's content.\n",
    "> lineNum refers to the line number. A single JSON command can modify the content of one line. When the subordinate machine receives a new command, the default OLED display screen at startup will disappear, replaced by the content you've added. For most products that use a 0.91-inch OLED display, the value of lineNum can be 0, 1, 2, or 3, allowing for a total of four lines. Text is the textual content you wish to display on that line. If the content for a line is too long, it will automatically wrap to the next line, potentially overwriting the content on the last line."

Running the following code block will display the current time on the OLED screen. Note that the time displayed might not be accurate due to potential discrepancies with the Raspberry Pi's clock. This example serves to demonstrate how to update the screen content in the main program, where we employ this method to display real-time information such as the device's IP address and operational status on the OLED screen."
