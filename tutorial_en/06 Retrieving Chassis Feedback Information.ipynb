    "### Function Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Non-blocking: This function employs a non-blocking reading approach, meaning it does not halt the program's execution even if there's no data to read from the serial port. It waits until data is available.\n",
    "- Efficient: By using a small buffer and limiting the read amount to a maximum of 512 bytes at a time, the function reduces memory consumption and promptly processes data to prevent buffer overflow.\n",
    "- Flexible: The function can flexibly read data of any length and automatically deals with data split by newline characters. This makes it particularly suitable for reading structured data like JSON.\n",
    "- Reliable: The function is designed to account for various scenarios, such as insufficient buffer data or absence of newline characters in the read data, ensuring the accuracy and stability of the read operations.\n",
    "- Ideal for Real-time Use: This function is especially well-suited for real-time reading of JSON data from a serial port, especially in scenarios where non-blocking reads are required."
