    "# Custom Command Line Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate secondary development of the product, we have added a command-line input window in the WEB application. You can input commands in this window, and after clicking the SEND button, the command will be sent to the upper computer application. The upper computer application will execute corresponding functionalities or parameter adjustments based on the command you send.\n",
    "\n",
    "We already have some ready-made commands that you can refer to in the following sections of the WEB Command Line Application to learn about those commands. In this section, we will introduce how to implement custom command-line functionality while explaining how this feature is implemented, making it easier for you to understand the subsequent sections.\n",

    "## Adding Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "The example routines for command-line functionality are written in the main program app.py, and they are handled by the cmdline_ctrl() function. Below is our default command-line instruction processing function. This function is incomplete because the content afterward deals with other functionalities, which are omitted here without affecting the understanding of the function itself.\n",
