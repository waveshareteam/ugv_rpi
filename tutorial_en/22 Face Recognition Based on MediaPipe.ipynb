    "## What is MediaPipe?\r\n",
    "\n",
    "MediaPipe is an open-source framework developed by Google for building machine learning-based multimedia processing applications. It provides a set of tools and libraries for processing video, audio, and image data, and applies machine learning models to achieve various functionalities such as pose estimation, gesture recognition, and face detection. MediaPipe is designed to offer efficient, flexible, and easy-to-use solutions, enabling developers to quickly build a variety of multimedia processing applications."

    "## Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the product automatically runs the main program at startup, which occupies the camera resource, this tutorial cannot be used in such situations. You need to terminate the main program or disable its automatic startup before restarting the robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that because the robot's main program uses multi-threading and is configured to run automatically at startup through crontab, the usual method sudo killall python typically doesn't work. Therefore, we'll introduce the method of disabling the automatic startup of the main program here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminate the Main Program\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click the \"+\" icon next to the tab for this page to open a new tab called \"Launcher.\"\n",
    "2. Click on \"Terminal\" under \"Other\" to open a terminal window.\n",
    "3. Type bash into the terminal window and press Enter.\n",
    "4. Now you can use the Bash Shell to control the robot.\n",
    "5. Enter the command: crontab -e.\n",
    "6. If prompted to choose an editor, enter 1 and press Enter to select nano.\n",
    "7. After opening the crontab configuration file, you'll see the following two lines:\n",
    "> @reboot ~/ugv_pt_rpi/ugv-env/bin/python ~/ugv_pt_rpi/app.py >> ~/ugv.log 2>&1\n",
    ">\n",
    ">@reboot /bin/bash ~/ugv_pt_rpi/start_jupyter.sh >> ~/jupyter_log.log 2>&1\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Add a # character at the beginning of the line with ……app.py >> …… to comment out this line.\n",
    "> #@reboot ~/ugv_pt_rpi/ugv-env/bin/python ~/ugv_pt_rpi/app.py >> ~/ugv.log 2>&1\n",
    ">\n",
    ">@reboot /bin/bash ~/ugv_pt_rpi/start_jupyter.sh >> ~/jupyter_log.log 2>&1\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Press Ctrl + X in the terminal window to exit. It will ask you Save modified buffer? Enter Y and press Enter to save the changes.\n",
    "10. Reboot the device. Note that this process will temporarily close the current Jupyter Lab session. If you didn't comment out ……start_jupyter.sh >>…… in the previous step, you can still use Jupyter Lab normally after the robot reboots (JupyterLab and the robot's main program app.py run independently). You may need to refresh the page.\n",
    "11. One thing to note is that since the lower machine continues to communicate with the upper machine through the serial port, the upper machine may not start up properly during the restart process due to the continuous change of serial port levels. Taking the case where the upper machine is a Raspberry Pi, after the Raspberry Pi is shut down and the green LED is constantly on without the green LED blinking, you can turn off the power switch of the robot, then turn it on again, and the robot will restart normally.\n",
    "12. Enter the reboot command: sudo reboot.\n",
    "13. After waiting for the device to restart (during the restart process, the green LED of the Raspberry Pi will blink, and when the frequency of the green LED blinking decreases or goes out, it means that the startup is successful), refresh the page and continue with the remaining part of this tutorial."
